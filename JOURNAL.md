## 10/19/2025 - Installed KiCad  

Good Morning all ,

This my first time doing something with hardware , I have zero experience so I decided to do Hackpad (Macropad thingy) , So After consulting the community I decided to install kicad 

Nothing much just installed it and did some yt research too , checked the hackpad repo , also I am waiting for my pinecil to arrive which I got from SOM

## 10/22/2025 - Y'all Plan changed  

After learning the new rule that I can only make one keyboard , So I did some reasearch and decided to do a 75% keyboard here is the basic design , Y'all I am quite slow so it took time , Idk what I am doing still doing it 

First I made macropad with Xiao 2040 , but scraped it then I transistioned to a keybaord with full sized pico so here it is

## 10/23/2025 - WTH is a diode!  

Y'all today I decided to do 84 keys (idk why this number) , Thinking to add a oled screen and a knob (for brightness and volm) and then I Started to work on it then I realized that how tf I would connect 84 keys to only 22 GPIO's (As I had learnt in HACKPAD) then I found I need something called Diode which I researched I found I need this type of Diode, Used ChatGPT for this and some keyboard projects for this (This took heck a lot of time). Also after consulting communites I fell in a dillema to choose b/w pico and Esp32
